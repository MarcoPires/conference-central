Design Choices
------------

##### Task 1: Add Sessions to a Conference
* Session is defined as a pure entity with Conference entity as ancestor, with the properties: 
    * Session name 
    * highlights 
    * Speaker
    * duration 
    * typeOfSession 
    * date 
    * start time (in 24 hour notation so it can be ordered). 
* Session also contains the following Endpoints methods 
    * **getConferenceSessions(websafeConferenceKey)** - Given a conference, return all sessions
    * **getConferenceSessionsByType(websafeConferenceKey, typeOfSession)** - Given a conference, return all sessions of a specified type (eg lecture, keynote, workshop)
    * **getSessionsBySpeaker(speaker)** - Given a speaker, return all sessions given by this particular speaker, across all conferences
    * **createSession(SessionForm, websafeConferenceKey)** - open only to the organizer of the conference

##### Task 2: Add Sessions to User Wishlist
* The wishlist stores the key of sessions in the user profile. The user can only add a session to their wishlist if he register in the conference.
    * **addSessionToWishlist(SessionKey)** - adds the session to the user's list of sessions they are interested in attending You can decide if they can only add conference they have registered to attend or if the wishlist is open to all conferences.
    * **getSessionsInWishlist()** - query for all the sessions in a conference that the user is interested in
    * **deleteSessionInWishlist(SessionKey)** - removes the session from the userâ€™s list of sessions they are interested in attending  

##### Task 3: Work on indexes and queries
* I've implemented 2 new queries
    * **getSessionsByMaxDuration(duration)** - Given a Duration, return all sessions under that duration, across all conferences
    * **getSessionsWithMissingInformation()** - Return all sessions that have void fields
* Regard to the query problem, the issue is that only one inequality filter per query is supported. My attempt at resolution is on next endpoit:
    * **getSessionsProblem()** - Return all sessions that starts before 7 pm and they are not workshops
    

##### Task 4: Add a Task
* Featured Speaker - A memcache entry is created when creating a new session and the speaker in question will have two or more sessions.
